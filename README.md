The Multi-Disease Prognosis System is an end-to-end machine learning–based healthcare application designed to assist in the early prediction of multiple critical diseases using patient clinical data.

The system integrates data preprocessing, predictive modeling, and web-based deployment into a unified framework. It allows users to input medical parameters and receive disease prediction results through an intuitive web interface.

This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in the healthcare domain, focusing on model reliability, modular architecture, and real-world deployment readiness.
